# Sentimental-Analysis-on-Twitter
Machine Learning

In this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Python. We pre-processed the tweets by removing special characters, stemming words, and extracting hashtags. Then, we visualized the most frequent words and hashtags using word clouds and bar plots. Finally, we built a Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment, achieving a certain level of accuracy and F1 score.
